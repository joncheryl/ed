# NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) study
This repository contains primarily two things:
1. Python scripts to integrate all the years of CCD data. Heavy use of Pandas Python package. This is found in the ccd_db folder.
2. Jupyter Notebooks investigating the relationship between education system financial expenditures and academic achievement. Visualizations made with Plotly. Here are two:
    - [Utah Specific Total Education Spending vs Academic Achievement](https://raw.githack.com/joncheryl/ed/main/state_level.html)
